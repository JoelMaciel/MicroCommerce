# About the project.


### *The MicroCommerce project is a microservices architecture composed of four main components: product, order service, notification and inventory.*
### Each microservice plays a specific role in the commerce ecosystem, ranging from product management to inventory control, ordering and notification services.*
### *This modular approach allows for scalability, easier maintenance and flexibility to evolve each service independently, contributing to the operational efficiency of the system as a whole.*
